Do firms exploit this property to benefit domestic production? Utilizing China's Solid Waste Import Ban (CSWIB) as a regulatory shock, we observe that the Producer Price Index (PPI) for U.S. waste-generating industries rose by 2.94% due to increased production costs post-CSWIB. Furthermore, firms within waste-generating sectors also exhibit a 6.49% drop in Tobinâ€™s Q. Our findings suggest that global waste management significantly affects inflation and firm valuation in the U.S., which carry important normative implications for global green transitions.","highlights":["with Tao Chen, Stephen Teng Sun, and Hong Zhang"],"startDate":"2024"}],"certificates":[{"name":"CICPA","date":"2019","issuer":"Accounting and Audit, ","icon":"fa-solid fa-scale-balanced"}],"skills":[{"name":"Machine Learning","level":"Proficient","icon":"fa-solid fa-robot"},{"name":"Textual Analysis","level":"Proficient","icon":"fa-solid fa-book"},{"name":"Stata","level":"Advanced","icon":"fa-solid fa-chart-line"}],"languages":[{"language":"Mandarin","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag"},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag"},{"language":"Cantonese","fluency":"Basic","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag"},{"language":"Korean","fluency":"Basic","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag"}],"interests":[{"name":"Dance","icon":"fa-solid fa-music","keywords":["I have performed on China Central Television (CCTV) as the lead dancer and have also been invited to perform by the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Singapore."]}]}
