I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Banking & Finance at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg), supervised by Professor Junkoo Kang. 


My primary research interest lies in FinTech, investment, and intangible assets. Especially the question: how technologies reshape corporate financial activities and investor decision-making and so the financial market efficiency.

I'm also interested in R&D and innovation.
